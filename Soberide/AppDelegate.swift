     My app is pretty straightforward to use. The main issue I am having right now is with the segues, so you do have to manually set certain
     views as the root view to test some screens (only the userview/admin view). I spent a lot of time structuring how I wanted my firebase database
     to look, so my registration pages had a lot of work put into them. Sorry I am turning this in almost three days late, I'm sure you already
     ready my email regarding my mono diagnosis this week. */
